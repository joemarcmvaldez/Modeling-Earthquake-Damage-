# Modeling-Earthquake-Damage-
My Intro to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Project in NTU where the dataset is pulled from https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/57/nepal-earthquake/ with a self-defined problem of finding the best building model that can widthstand recent earthquakes.
My team was able to achieve a 71.1% accuracy in predicting the damage_grade of a building. 
The output.xlsx is the submitted predictions of the test_values.csv.
